2009-08-21  v0.9.2

	* Fix to work with Tomboy > 0.10

2007-09-19  v0.9.1

	* Builds with Tomboy > 0.7.2
	* Minor bugfixing

2005-05-11  v0.7

	* Builds nicely with tomboy-0.3.2, using pkg-config.
	  
2005-04-13  v0.6

	* Repairs a Bug when adding then removing and readding a date on the same
	  note the event would fire anyway.
	
	* Also fixed a GLib timout handling problem leading to crash, hopefully !
	  
	  
2005-04-11  v0.5

	* Set the note visible on top of other windows (not only bolded in the taskbar)
	  when a reminder triggers.
	  
	* Support for date and time. Both 12 and 24-hour format recognized. If a time
	  is specified the note shows at that time, if a date only is specified the note
	  pops-up every 30 min that day starting at 00:00, and if both date and time are
	  set, the note show at that date and time once.
	
	* Updated README to reflect changes
	
	* Thanks to Yehoshua Sapir <yasapir@gmail.com> for the time handling idea and code
	  
	  
2005-04-10  v0.4

	* Uses Glib.Timeout instead of ThreadNotify, less crash-prone, i hope
	  
	* Wait before the initial scan of tomboy notes, should prevent the
	  blank note problem that appeared sometimes..
	  
	
2005-03-04  v0.3

	* Removed the yellow popup, now the reminder shows the tomboy note window
	  itself, so one can edit and view the note when reminded.
	
	* When closing a note that has a reminder for today, it reappears 1 hour 
	  later the same day (snooze)
	  
	* Various fixes, notably the window closed should now be correct (it
	  isn't closed, it's hidden !)
	  
	* DBus 0.23.2 is needed to make tomboy plugins work correctly !


2005-02-05  v0.2

	* Changed the update method. Now scans at startup and at note closing.
	
	* Improved date matching, dates like "next monday" are recognized
	
	* Added a new reminder marker "remind date" or "alert date"
	
	* French date matching support "mardi prochain" or "rappel date" or "!24 d√©cembre"
