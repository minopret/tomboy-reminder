Tomboy Reminder Plugin
----------------------

Requirements
------------
This plugin requires:
tomboy-0.10 or higher

Build and Install
-----------------
Simply run

./configure
make
make install (as root)

It should install the tomboy-reminder in the tomboy addins directory.
You can then enable it via the tomboy interface.

Using the Reminder
------------------
To use the plugin simply write a note and when you want to be reminded for
this note, you have two options:
    - put somewhere a "!" followed by a date at which tomboy will
      show a popup with the note content at specified date.
    - write "remind date" or "alert date" or "rappel date"
    
The date format is quite loose you can write anything like:
	4th july
	2005/05/03
	5th
	3 september 05
	next monday
	monday

Starting from v0.5 you can alo use time in the date, both 12- and 24-hour times
are recognized, for example:
	12am
	23:34
	10h
	10h am

You can also combine the two:
	3 july at 12am
	2004/04/02 a 22:50
	monday @ 2h am

In general just write down the date and time as you would naturally it should
work, if not, it's a bug ;)

You can NOT use the "american" or "european" date format "mm/dd/yyyy"
or "dd/mm/yyy" because it is not clear wether the first two digits are
months or days.

Tomboy will scan all the notes shortly after being started and when a note is closed.
* When a date is found, the note will popup that date starting at 00:00 and every
  30min when you close it.
* When a time is found the note will popup at the given time the same day, only once
* When both time and date are found, the note will popup the specified date at the
  specified time, only once
